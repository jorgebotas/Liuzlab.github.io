NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences grant for developing statistical methods for integrated analysis of multiple high-dimensional omics datasets. Total award: $469,342 (FY2012). This research uses exponential family distributions to generalize PCA and graphical models for joint analysis of transcriptional, epi-genomics and functional genomics data to discover molecular cancer sub-types and disease networks.
