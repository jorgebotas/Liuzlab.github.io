NIH R01 grant for functional dissection of Alzheimer's Disease networks in Drosophila, from association to causal modulators of age-dependent neurodegeneration. Total award: $679,825 (FY2017). This cross-species strategy accelerates discovery and functional dissection of AD molecular networks derived from human brain transcriptomes and proteomes.
