# AI & Computational Methods

Our lab develops cutting-edge AI and machine learning methods specifically designed to solve challenging problems in genomics and systems biology. We create innovative algorithms that can extract meaningful biological insights from complex, high-dimensional genomic data, enabling discoveries that would be impossible through traditional approaches.

## Key Research Areas

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Developing specialized architectures for modeling molecular interactions and biological networks
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapting pre-trained models for biomedical applications with limited labeled data
- **Representation Learning**: Creating informative embeddings for genes, variants, and biological entities
- **Interpretable AI**: Building transparent models that provide biological insights alongside predictions

### Statistical Methods
- **Graphical Models**: Employing Bayesian networks and probabilistic graphical models for modeling regulatory relationships
- **High-Dimensional Statistics**: Developing methods for analyzing genomic data with thousands of variables
- **Causal Inference**: Inferring causal relationships from observational biological data
- **Regularization Methods**: Implementing sparse learning techniques (Lasso, elastic net) for feature selection in genomic studies

### Data Integration
- **Multi-Omics Integration**: Combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other data types
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Building comprehensive biological knowledge bases
- **Cross-Species Analysis**: Leveraging model organism data to understand human biology
- **Heterogeneous Data Fusion**: Integrating structured databases with unstructured literature
