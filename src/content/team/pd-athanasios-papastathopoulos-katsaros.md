Athanasios Papastathopoulos-Katsaros (Thanos) is a computational scientist whose career trajectory (from physics to material science, quantum chemistry, quantitative finance, and data science) reflects his passion for applying mathematical modeling to complex systems. He earned his B.S. in Physics from the University of Crete (2018) and his Ph.D. in Computational Quantum Chemistry from Rice University (2023). 

Curently, Thanos is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Liu Lab at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital where he develops machine learning models for biomedical informatics. His notable contributions as a postdoc include **PINN-extrapolation** ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12659),[pub](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-04555-3_24)), a method for increasing physics-informed neural network extrapolation accuracy by 40% with minimal added computational cost, and **PFCGR** ([arxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.03.657533v2.abstract),[pub](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11273393)), a machine learning pipeline for genomic sequence analysis that is 90% faster than DNABERT with similar performance.
