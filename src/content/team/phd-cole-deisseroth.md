Cole is a student in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Baylor College of Medicine, currently completing PhD training in the Genetics & Genomics Graduate Program. His primary interest is in fully automated methods that use publicly available data to identify pharmacologic protein regulators, which will hopefully aid in the management of some Mendelian disorders.

Past tools developed include **ClinPhen**, which automatically extracts disease phenotypes from a medical record to facilitate Mendelian disease diagnosis; and **PARsing ModifiErS via Article aNnotations (PARMESAN)**, which automatically curates the literature to identify regulatory effects of gene products and drugs, and uses the pathway information curated to predict unreported regulatory effects. He is now exploring the ability of RNA-Seq data to further bolster this predictive effort.
