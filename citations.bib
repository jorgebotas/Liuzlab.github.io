	abstract = {1718 Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an asbestos-related malignancy characterized by rapid progressive local growth, late metastases, and poor prognosis despite aggressive strategies involving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The Stratifin (14-3-3 sigma) has been shown to regulate vital cellular processes that are important in cancer development, such as mitogenic signal transduction, apoptosis and cell cycle progression. In this study we have elucidated the gene expression profile of stratifin among 24 MPM tumor samples using Affymetrix U133AB chip platform. We noticed 14/24 tumors had more than 2-fold induction in their stratifin gene expression patterns compared to three normal peritoneums. Increased Stratifin expression was observed in majority of epithelial histotypes including small subset of biphasics that exhibited longer survival time (\&gt;14 months) after surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed cytoplasmic positivity of stratifin in 23/57 MPM tumor samples with minimal staining in surrounding stromal region. Unique three phospho-serine binding motif partners of stratifin (30-80 KDa) were identified among high-stratifin expressing MPM tumors by Western blot analysis. We also found \&gt; 4-fold increased stratifin gene expression pattern in five out of six MPM patient derived cell lines. A robust 2-fold induction in stratifin gene expression was found as a consequence of 5’-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-AzaC) treatment of SV 40 viral-infected primary mesothelial cultures. Studies are underway to assess whether stratifin promoter hypermethylation is involved in the down-regulation of its expression pattern seen among fifty percent of MPM tumor samples. Further studies are needed to understand the regulation and interaction of stratifin in mesothelioma carcinogenesis that could be utilized for future therapeutic approaches to combat this insidious disease.},

	abstract = {The RNA binding protein LIN28 and its paralog LIN28B function at a critical junction of pleuripotency, metabolism and metastasis. Reactivation of LIN28 has been recently reported in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), where it is hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining tumor stem cells. Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the LIN28B promoter and ovarian cancer susceptibility have also been identified. However, the clinical significance of these observations and the mechanisms by which either LIN28 gene contributes to ovarian cancer have not been explored.Using Western blot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry, we found that a) LIN28 but not LIN28B is highly expressed in epithelia lining the distal fallopian tube and b) reactivation of LIN28 (1/8 specimens) and dysregulated expression of LIN28B (4/8 specimens) occur in EOC. To assess clinical significance of these events, we interrogated the TCGA ovarian cancer database, examining correlations between LIN28, LIN28B expression and outcomes by Kaplan-Meier analysis (n=581). Our results indicate that LIN28 expression is associated with shorter disease free interval in women with optimally debulked high grade serous ovarian cancers (p\&lt;0.05). Significantly higher levels of LIN28B were also noted in young (age \&lt;50) women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Using serial logistic regression with L1 normalization (Lasso analysis), we discovered LIN28 levels correlated most robustly with multiple genes rather than miRNAs: APOC3 (β =0.74), FGG (β =0.69), HBG1(β=0.67) and HEMGN (β =0.67). Although associations between LIN28 and miRNAs predicted by current models were not observed, robust correlations between LIN28B and multiple miRNAs were detected: let-7b (β =-0.47), let-7d (β =-0.34), let-7i (β =-0.31) as well as others [miR-222 (β=-0.29), let-7e, miR-222, miR-324-5p] not previously known to be regulated by either LIN28 gene. Lastly, we found that expression of LIN28B but not LIN28 was induced by culturing A2780 and TOV112D ovarian cancer cells in media that promotes self-assembly into spheroids. Knockdown of LIN28B expression confirms that LIN28B directly regulates the let-7 and other miRNAs identified by our analyses, promotes spheroid assembly and in vivo tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cell lines.Collectively, these observations indicate that LIN28 likely plays an important role in regenerating epithelia that normally line the distal fallopian tube. Although our data also suggest that reactivation of LIN28 plays a key role in promoting ovarian cancer recurrences, LIN28 does not contribute to this process by targeting the differentiation of pluripotent cells via a let-7-mediated mechanism. Rather, this role appears to be most robust for its paralog LIN28B. Future work will focus on further dissecting the unique roles of these two gene products in ovarian cancer initiation and metastasis as well as their response to treatment.Citation Format: Claire Mach, Ying-Wooi Wan, Zhandong Liu, Matthew L.

            A SOlution for MDS in humanized mice
            
              MECP2
              duplication syndrome (MDS) is a genetic disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, motor dysfunctions, and seizures.
              MECP2
              -specific antisense oligonucleotides (
              MECP2
              -ASOs) have shown promising results in mice, normalizing MeCP2 protein concentration in the brain. In anticipation of clinical trials, Shao
              et al
              . now generated a humanized mouse model of MDS that carries two human
              MECP2
              alleles and no mouse endogenous alleles. The authors characterized the effects of
              MECP2
              -ASO intracerebral administration and showed a dose-dependent reduction in MeCP2 expression in the brain. The treatment reversed behavioral and molecular abnormalities in this model, suggesting that the approach might be therapeutic in patients with MDS.
            
          , 
            
              Many intellectual disability disorders are due to copy number variations, and, to date, there have been no treatment options tested for this class of diseases.
              MECP2
              duplication syndrome (MDS) is one of the most common genomic rearrangements in males and results from duplications spanning the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (
              MECP2
              ) gene locus. We previously showed that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy can reduce MeCP2 protein amount in an MDS mouse model and reverse its disease features. This MDS mouse model, however, carried one transgenic human allele and one mouse allele, with the latter being protected from human-specific
              MECP2
              -ASO targeting. Because MeCP2 is a dosage-sensitive protein, the ASO must be titrated such that the amount of MeCP2 is not reduced too far, which would cause Rett syndrome. Therefore, we generated an “
              MECP2
              humanized” MDS model that carries two human
              MECP2
              alleles and no mouse endogenous allele. Intracerebroventricular injection of the
              MECP2
              -ASO efficiently down-regulated MeCP2 expression throughout the brain in these mice. Moreover,
              MECP2
              -ASO mitigated several behavioral deficits and restored expression of selected MeCP2-regulated genes in a dose-dependent manner without any toxicity. Central nervous system administration of
              MECP2
              -ASO is therefore well tolerated and beneficial in this mouse model and provides a translatable approach that could be feasible for treating MDS.},

              Background
              Deconvolution analyses have been widely used to track compositional alterations of cell types in gene expression data. Although a large number of novel methods have been developed, due to a lack of understanding of the effects of modeling assumptions and tuning parameters, it is challenging for researchers to select an optimal deconvolution method suitable for the targeted biological conditions.
            
            
              Results
              To systematically reveal the pitfalls and challenges of deconvolution analyses, we investigate the impact of several technical and biological factors including simulation model, quantification unit, component number, weight matrix, and unknown content by constructing three benchmarking frameworks. These frameworks cover comparative analysis of 11 popular deconvolution methods under 1766 conditions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We provide new insights to researchers for future application, standardization, and development of deconvolution tools on RNA-seq data.},

              Loss-of-function mutations in
              MECP2
              cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome (RTT), but the precise molecular mechanism driving pathogenesis remains unclear. Using an unbiased approach to identify proteins that interact with MeCP2, we identified the transcription factor 20 (TCF20) complex and discovered that RTT-causing mutations in
              MECP2
              disrupt this interaction. Using biochemical, morphological, behavioral, and transcriptional studies, we examined the importance of this interaction for brain function and found that the TCF20 complex plays a direct role in MeCP2-dependent gene regulation and modifies
              MECP2
              -induced synaptic and behavioral deficits. Our data uncovered a previously unknown molecular aspect of MeCP2 function and revealed a converging molecular mechanism, whereby mutations of genes encoding several subunits in the same complex contribute to shared neurological symptoms.
            
          , 
            
              MeCP2 is associated with Rett syndrome (RTT),
              MECP2
              duplication syndrome, and a number of conditions with isolated features of these diseases, including autism, intellectual disability, and motor dysfunction. MeCP2 is known to broadly bind methylated DNA, but the precise molecular mechanism driving disease pathogenesis remains to be determined. Using proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID), we identified a transcription factor 20 (TCF20) complex that interacts with MeCP2 at the chromatin interface. Importantly, RTT-causing mutations in

              Background
              Single-cell omics technology is rapidly developing to measure the epigenome, genome, and transcriptome across a range of cell types. However, it is still challenging to integrate omics data from different modalities. Here, we propose a variation of the Siamese neural network framework called MinNet, which is trained to integrate multi-omics data on the single-cell resolution by using graph-based contrastive loss.
            
            
              Results
              By training the model and testing it on several benchmark datasets, we showed its accuracy and generalizability in integrating scRNA-seq with scATAC-seq, and scRNA-seq with epitope data. Further evaluation demonstrated our model's unique ability to remove the batch effect, a common problem in actual practice. To show how the integration impacts downstream analysis, we established model-based smoothing and cis-regulatory element-inferring method and validated it with external pcHi-C evidence. Finally, we applied the framework to a COVID-19 dataset to bolster the original work with integration-based analysis, showing its necessity in single-cell multi-omics research.
            
            
              Conclusions
              MinNet is a novel deep-learning framework for single-cell multi-omics sequencing data integration. It ranked top among other methods in benchmarking and is especially suitable for integrating datasets with batch and biological variances. With the single-cell resolution integration results, analysis of the interplay between genome and transcriptome can be done to help researchers understand their data and question.},

            Genomic copy-number variations (CNVs) that can cause neurodevelopmental disorders often encompass many genes, which complicates our understanding of how individual genes within a CNV contribute to pathology. MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS or MRXSL in OMIM; OMIM\#300260) is one such CNV disorder caused by duplications spanning methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) and other genes on Xq28. Using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to normalize MECP2 dosage is sufficient to rescue abnormal neurological phenotypes in mouse models overexpressing MECP2 alone, implicating the importance of increased MECP2 dosage within CNVs of Xq28. However, because MDS CNVs span MECP2 and additional genes, we generated human neurons from multiple MDS patient-derived induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) to evaluate the benefit of using an ASO against MECP2 in a MDS human neuronal context. Importantly, we identified a signature of genes that is partially and qualitatively modulated upon ASO treatment, pinpointed genes sensitive to MeCP2 function, and altered in a model of Rett syndrome, a neurological disorder caused by loss of MeCP2 function. Furthermore, the signature contained genes that are aberrantly altered in unaffected control human neurons upon MeCP2 depletion, revealing gene expression programs qualitatively sensitive to MeCP2 levels in human neurons. Lastly, ASO treatment led to a partial rescue of abnormal neuronal morphology in MDS neurons. All together, these data demonstrate that ASOs targeting MECP2 benefit human MDS neurons. Moreover, our study establishes a paradigm by which to evaluate the contribution of individual genes within a CNV to pathogenesis and to assess their potential as a therapeutic target.},

            Olfactory sensory neurons within the nasal epithelium detect volatile odorants and relay odor information to the central nervous system. Unlike other sensory inputs, olfactory sensory neurons interface with the external environment and project their axons directly into the central nervous system. The use of adeno-associated viruses to target these neurons has garnered interest for applications in gene therapy, probing olfactory sensory neuron biology, and modeling disease. To date, there is no consensus on the optimal AAV serotype for efficient and selective transduction of olfactory sensory neurons
            in vivo
            . Here we utilized serial confocal imaging and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to evaluate the efficacy of 11 different AAV serotypes in transducing murine olfactory sensory neurons via non-invasive nasal inoculation. Our results reveal that AAV1, while highly effective, exhibited broad tropism, whereas AAV-DJ/8 showed the greatest specificity for olfactory sensory neurons.},

            In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), changes in the brain transcriptome are hypothesized to mediate the impact of neuropathology on cognition. Gene expression profiling from postmortem brain tissue is a promising approach to identify causal pathways; however, there are challenges to definitively resolve the upstream pathologic triggers along with the downstream consequences for AD clinical manifestations. We have functionally dissected 30 AD-associated gene coexpression modules using a cross-species strategy in fruit fly (
            Drosophila melanogaster
            ) models. Integrating longitudinal RNA-sequencing and behavioral phenotyping, we interrogated the unique and shared transcriptional responses to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and/or aging, along with potential links to progressive neuronal dysfunction. Our results highlight hundreds of conserved, differentially expressed genes mapping to human AD regulatory networks. To confirm causal modules and pinpoint AD network drivers, we performed systematic
            in vivo
            genetic manipulations of 357 conserved, prioritized targets, identifying 141 modifiers of Aβ- and/or tau-induced neurodegeneration. We discover an up-regulated network that is significantly enriched for both AD risk variants and markers of immunity / inflammation, and which promotes Aβ and tau-mediated neurodegeneration based on fly genetic manipulations in neurons. By contrast, a synaptic regulatory network is strongly downregulated in human brains with AD and is enriched for loss-of-function suppressors of Aβ/tau in
            Drosophila
            . Additional experiments suggest that this human brain transcriptional module may respond to and modulate Aβ-induced glutamatergic hyperactivation injury. In sum, our cross-species, systems genetic approach establishes a putative causal chain linking AD pathology, large-scale gene expression perturbations, and ultimately, neurodegeneration.},

To answer this question, we aim to assess the diagnostic performance of LLMs in rare diseases, and explore methods to enhance their effectiveness in this area. In this work, we introduce a rare disease question-answering (ReDis-QA) dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in diagnosing rare diseases. Specifically, we collected 1360 high-quality question-answer pairs within the ReDis-QA dataset, covering 205 rare diseases. Additionally, we annotated meta-data for each question, facilitating the extraction of subsets specific to any given disease and its property. Based on the ReDis-QA dataset, we benchmarked several open-source LLMs, revealing that diagnosing rare diseases remains a significant challenge for these models.
 To facilitate retrieval augmentation generation for rare disease diagnosis, we collect the first rare diseases corpus (ReCOP), sourced from the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) database. Specifically, we split the report of each rare disease into multiple chunks, each representing a different property of the disease, including their overview, symptoms, causes, effects, related disorders, diagnosis, and standard therapies. This structure ensures that the information within each chunk aligns consistently with a question. Experiment results demonstrate that ReCOP can effectively improve the accuracy of LLMs on the ReDis-QA dataset by an average of 8\%. Moreover, it significantly guides LLMs to generate trustworthy answers and explanations that can be traced back to existing literature.},

            Recent advances in single-cell multi-omics technologies have provided unprecedented insights into regulatory processes. We introduce TREASMO, a versatile Python package designed to quantify and visualize transcriptional regulatory dynamics in single-cell multi-omics datasets. TREASMO has four modules, spanning data preparation, correlation quantification, downstream analysis and visualization, enabling comprehensive dataset exploration. By introducing a novel single-cell gene–peak correlation strength index, TREASMO facilitates accurate identification of regulatory changes at single-cell resolution. Validation on a hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell dataset showcases TREASMO’s capacity in quantifying the gene–peak correlation strength at the single-cell level, identifying regulatory markers and discovering temporal regulatory patterns along the trajectory.},

            Physical exercise represents a primary defense against age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To impartially investigate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted single-nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses (snRNA-seq and ATAC-seq) on the hippocampus of mice carrying AD-linked NL-G-F mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP
            NL-G-F
            ) following prolonged voluntary wheel-running exercise. Our study reveals that exercise mitigates amyloid-induced changes in both transcriptomic expression and chromatin accessibility through cell type-specific transcriptional regulatory networks. These networks converge on the activation of growth factor signaling pathways, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin signaling, correlating with an increased proportion of immature dentate granule cells and oligodendrocytes. Notably, the beneficial effects of exercise on neurocognitive functions can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and the downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). Furthermore, exercise leads to elevated levels of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) in the blood, and intranasal administration of HB-EGF enhances memory function in sedentary APP
            NL-G-F
            mice. These findings offer a panoramic delineation of cell type-specific hippocampal transcriptional networks activated by exercise and suggest EGF-related growth factor signaling as a druggable contributor to exercise-induced memory enhancement, thereby suggesting therapeutic avenues for combatting AD-related cognitive decline.},

          Spatial transcriptomics, situated at the intersection of genomics and spatial biology, offers profound insights into the spatial organization of gene expression within tissues. However, its potential has been constrained by either limited resolution or throughput. While single-cell RNA-seq allows for in-depth profiling of cellular gene expression, the crucial spatial information is often sacrificed during sample collection. In a groundbreaking fusion of these two techniques, our research introduces the glmSMA computational algorithm. This innovative approach aims to predict cell locations by integrating scRNA-seq data with spatial-omics reference atlases. The essence of glmSMA lies in formulating cell mapping as a convex problem, strategically minimizing differences between cellular expression profiles and location expression profiles through L1 and Generalized L2 regularization. Our algorithm has undergone rigorous testing across diverse tissues, including mouse brain, drosophila embryo, and human PDAC samples. The compelling results validate glmSMA’s efficacy, demonstrating its capability to faithfully recapitulate spatial gene expression and anatomical structures. This marks a significant stride forward in overcoming the limitations of existing spatial transcriptomic techniques.},

However, this approach significantly increases computational costs, both monetarily and environmentally. The widely-used self-consistency method further exacerbates these costs by aggregating multiple reasoning paths to improve accuracy, often requiring between 40 to 64 samples per task. Although aggregation effectively reduces variance and bias, additional sampling can lead to diminishing returns when early samples yield consistent results. To address inefficiencies, we propose leveraging Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT) to dynamically terminate sampling once sufficient consistency is achieved. We calibrate SPRT parameters specifically for LLM applications, accounting for sensitivity to detect the mode of the distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating SPRT significantly enhances token efficiency, achieving comparable accuracy to self-consistency methods but at a substantially reduced computational cost. To promote transparency and facilitate reproducibility, we have made the source code and datasets used in our experiments publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/LiuzLab/consol, or available as a PyPI package: pip install consol.

              In the rapidly advancing field of ‘omics research, there is an increasing demand for sophisticated bioinformatic tools to enable efficient and consistent data analysis. As biological datasets, particularly metabolomics, become larger and more complex, innovative strategies are essential for deciphering the intricate molecular and cellular networks. 
             
             
              Methods 
              We introduce a pioneering analytical approach that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Graphical Lasso (GLASSO). This method is designed to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while preserving significant variance. For the first time, we applied the PCA-GLASSO algorithm (i.e., MetaboLINK) to metabolomics data derived from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy performed on neural cells at various developmental stages, from human embryonic stem cells to neurons. 
             
             
              Results 
              The MetaboLINK analysis of longitudinal metabolomics data has revealed distinct pathways related to amino acids, lipids, and energy metabolism, uniquely associated with specific cell progenies. These findings suggest that different metabolic pathways play a critical role at different stages of cellular development, each contributing to diverse cellular functions. 
             
             
              Discussion

            Single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, but automating its analysis remains an open challenge. Cell-type annotation represents a critical bottleneck, particularly as datasets grow in size and complexity. While foundation models have shown promise in addressing this challenge, existing approaches require extensive fine-tuning for effective cell-type annotation. Here, we present Lemur (

            Drosophila melanogaster 
            . Lemur achieves fine-tuning-free cell-type annotation through comprehensive pre-training on an integrated whole-organism atlas with a unified cell-type annotation schema. To leverage this unified schema, we developed a dedicated hierarchical cell-type decoder architecture. This approach enables Lemur to generate consistent cell-type predictions across multiple levels of granularity without requiring additional training on new datasets. The model demonstrates strong performance across diverse tissue types, experimental conditions, and sequencing technologies. It also achieves batch-effect correction without explicitly training for this task. This automated analysis capability positions Lemur as an effective tool for the fly research community. Beyond its immediate applications, Lemur establishes a framework for accelerating biological discovery. It enables rapid iteration between computational predictions and experimental validation in the highly controlled

While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30\% accuracy in ranking causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted diagnostics and therapies.},

            Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurological disorder caused by 
            MECP2 
            mutations. Like other X-linked disorders, RTT patients have sex-specific differences in clinical presentation due to distinct cellular environments, where females have ∼50\% of cells expressing either a mutant or wild-type copy of 
            MECP2 
            (mosaic) and males have 100\% of cells expressing a mutant 
            MECP2 
            (non-mosaic). Typical RTT females have a short window of normal early development until ∼6-18 months, followed by regression and progressive decline, whereas neonatal encephalopathy is more likely in RTT males. How these sex-specific differences in cellular context contribute molecularly to RTT pathogenesis, particularly in the presymptomatic stages of RTT females, remains poorly understood. Here, we profiled the hippocampal transcriptomes of female ( 
            Mecp2 
            +/- 
            ) and male ( 
            Mecp2 
            -/y 
            ) RTT mice at early timepoints using both bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq, including sorted MeCP2 positive (MeCP2+) and MeCP2 negative (MeCP2-) neurons in female mice. We identified a core disease signature consisting of 12 genes consistently dysregulated only in MeCP2-cells across RTT models. Moreover, we uncovered non-cell-autonomous effects exclusively in female MeCP2+ excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory circuits are more vulnerable early in the mosaic RTT environment. The single-nuclei data also revealed that a previously underappreciated MeCP2-interneuron subtype had the most transcriptional dysregulation in both male and female RTT hippocampi. Together, these data highlight the different effects of MeCP2 loss on excitatory and inhibitory circuits between the mosaic and non-mosaic environment that appear early in RTT pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Diagnosing rare diseases requires linking gene findings with often unstructured reference text. Current pipelines collect many candidate genes, but clinicians still spend a lot of time filtering false positives and combining evidence from papers and databases. A key challenge is language: phenotype descriptions and inheritance patterns are written in prose, not fully captured by tables. Large language models (LLMs) can read such text, but clinical use needs grounding in citable knowledge and stable, repeatable behavior. We explore a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking layer on top of a high-recall first-stage pipeline. The goal is to improve precision and explainability, not to replace standard bioinformatics steps. We use expert-built context and a consensus method to reduce LLM variability, producing shorter, better-justified gene lists for expert review. LA-MARRVEL achieves the highest accuracy, outperforming other methods -- including traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools (AI-MARRVEL, Exomiser, LIRICAL) and naive large language models (e.g., Anthropic Claude) -- with an average Recall@5 of 94.10\%, a +3.65 percentage-point improvement over AI-MARRVEL. The LLM-generated reasoning provides clear prose on phenotype matching and inheritance patterns, making clinical review faster and easier. LA-MARRVEL has three parts: expert-engineered context that enriches phenotype and disease information; a ranked voting algorithm that combines multiple LLM runs to choose a consensus ranked gene list; and the AI-MARRVEL pipeline that provides first-stage ranks and gene annotations, already known as a state-of-the-art method in Rare Disease Diagnosis on BG, DDD, and UDN cohorts. The online AI-MARRVEL includes LA-MARRVEL as an LLM feature at https://ai.marrvel.org . We evaluate LA-MARRVEL on three datasets from independent cohorts of real-world diagnosed patients.},

          Rare disease variant interpretation requires navigating multiple genomic databases with strict input formats and synthesizing heterogeneous evidence, creating barriers for non-experts and cognitive burdens even for specialists. MARRVEL exemplifies this challenge by requiring precise queries (e.g., HGVS notation) and returning complex, difficult-to-synthesize outputs. To address this input-output asymmetry, we developed MARRVEL-MCP, a natural language interface enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform end-to-end variant interpretation via structured tool access. 
           
            This work demonstrates the impact of 
            context engineering 
            —the deliberate design of domain-aware tool environments and information scaffolding—in reshaping the role of model scale in genomics. MARRVEL-MCP equips LLMs with 39 tools spanning gene and variant utilities, pathogenicity databases, phenotype resources, expression atlases, ortholog data, and literature APIs. Without hard-coded pipelines, LLMs autonomously infer workflows, performing named-entity recognition, identifier normalization, and multi-database synthesis from narrative queries. 
           
          Using 45 expert-curated questions, lightweight models (3B–20B parameters) with MARRVEL-MCP matched or outperformed larger models lacking tool access. A 20B-parameter model (gpt-oss-20b) achieved a 95\% pass rate versus 33\% without MARRVEL-MCP, approaching state-of-the-art proprietary performance. Although accuracy remains below the 100\% required for autonomous diagnosis and token usage is considerable, these results show that well-designed context can compensate for limited model capacity. 
           
            These findings establish context engineering as a core principle for biomedical AI, enabling efficient, scalable integration of LLMs with curated genomic resources. MARRVEL-MCP is available at

              Motivation 
              Rare diseases remain difficult to diagnose due to limited patient data and genetic diversity, with many cases remaining undiagnosed despite advances in variant prioritization tools. While large language models have shown promise in medical applications, their optimal application for trustworthy and accurate gene prioritization downstream of modern prioritization tools has not been systematically evaluated. 
             
             
              Results 
              We benchmarked various language models for gene prioritization using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology classification approaches to categorize patient cases by phenotype-based solvability levels. To address language model limitations in ranking large gene sets, we implemented a divide-and-conquer strategy with mini-batching and token limiting for improved efficiency. GPT-4 outperformed other language models across all patient datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in ranking causal genes. Multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology classification approaches effectively distinguished between confidently-solved and challenging cases. However, we observed bias toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity as notable language model limitations. Our divide-and-conquer strategy enhanced accuracy, overcoming positional and gene frequency biases in literature. This framework optimized the overall process for identifying disease-causal genes compared to baseline evaluation, better enabling targeted diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and streamlining diagnosis of rare genetic disorders.
